#Data file Sculpin_Alter.txt
#From the Arctic LTER data site – 
#   http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/data_doc/lakes/fish/89hes6ag.html
#This file describes the sculpins that were captured from Lake S-6 during the 
#  summers of 1988 and 1989. The weights, lengths, and ages of the fish are 
#  included in the file. This data is part of Kristi's masters research under 
#  Anne Hershey. 
#Sculpins were captured using canning jars with acetate funnels inserted in them 
#  (similar in design to some minnow traps). The sculpin traps were set by raft 
#  and placed on the bottom of the lake in a specific habitat (inshore, rocky, 
#  rock-mud interface, and mud bottom). (Roughly) every three days the traps 
#  were retrieved and the sculpins, if any, were removed. The ages of the fish 
#  were determined by counting the rings in their otoliths.
# Wt is in g, TL is in mm
