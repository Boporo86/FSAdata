# Relationships between otoliths and spines and otoliths and scales are exact
#   according to Figure 2.  Relationship between spines and scales is approximate
#   as Figure 2 did not show this exact relationship.

# otolith: age (years) assigned from broken, ground, and polished otolith sections.
# spine: age (years) assigned from dorsal spine sections.
# scale: age (years) assigned from scale impressions.
# sex: sex of fish (female, male).
